# <Note Taker>

## A place to write, keep and delete notes. 

- Building a working app with starter code only for front end. I did all the back end, and connections. 
- More building within a CLI, and getting comfortable starting and using local servers. 
- A simple place to keep notes handy. I think of it as a "TO DO:" list. 
- I learned that it's really annoying to have to restart the server everytime to want to run the app.
